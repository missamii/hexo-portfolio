![](images/8.png)Hello my name it Tiffany and I am a Full Stack Developer with a big heart for Frontend Development and User Experience. When I was 12 years old, I started off teaching myself how to design web layouts and then how to code. I have managed and hosted various websites since then. From online forum communities centered around web design, tutorial sites, resource/graphic design sites to simple blogs.

Hello my name it Tiffany and I am a Full Stack Developer with a big heart for Frontend Development and User Experience. When I was 12 years old, I started off teaching myself how to design web layouts and then how to code. I have managed and hosted various websites since then. From online forum communities centered around web design, tutorial sites, resource/graphic design sites to simple blogs.

College wasn't an option for me in those early days. All through my teens and early 20’s I was designing and coding. When I was 18 years old. I had the privilege to attend The Art Institute of New York City for a short while. Then for financial reasons, I was forced to focus on stabilizing myself financially and couldn’t focus on studies and paying for school. I feel into a void for a few years, working in an industry (retail) I was not passionate. However, it always served as a constant reminded of who I started out to become and my goals in life. A few years ago I was able to attend a coding Bootcamp, [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/). There I flourish and powered thru challenges alone and at times with my fellow cohort as a team.

Now a days I volunteer as a Tech Lead for [CHAYN](chayn.co), a nonprofit that leverages technology to empower victims & survivors of abuse. What I am most proud of is being able to use my skills to help thousands to millions of people who search online for the help they need.

<!-- Right now we are working on rolling out a course to help people who have experience abuse or maybe currently experience abuse. The platform is called Soul Medicine. For this project, I will be the Front End Developer. When I am not working with CHAYN, I keep busy taking on Freelancer projects with my side business Tiffany Lo Designs. -->
